# NLP Chatbot: Contextual Question-Answering System

An intelligent chatbot system powered by BERT NLP model that answers questions based on user-provided context with high accuracy and interactive web interface.

##  Overview

This project implements a sophisticated NLP chatbot that can answer questions based on context provided by users. The system utilizes the **deepset/bert-base-cased-squad2** model, a variant of BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) that has been fine-tuned for question-answering tasks. The model was further trained on the Natural Questions dataset to enhance its performance on contextual question answering.

##  Key Features

- **BERT-based Q&A**: Utilizes `deepset/bert-base-cased-squad2` model for accurate answer extraction
- **Interface**: Web-based chat interface with responsive design
- **High Accuracy**: Achieved 80.11% F1 score on validation data
- **Easy Integration**: Flask-based backend with Bootstrap frontend
- **Real-time Processing**: Fast tokenization and answer prediction
- **Context-aware**: Extracts precise answers from provided text passages

##  Installation & Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rahmaeBrahi/Chatbot-NLP.git
   cd Chatbot-NLP
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Download the trained model**
   
   The pre-trained model files are not included in the repository due to size constraints. You can download the trained model from the following link:
   
   **ðŸ“¥ [Download Trained Model](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/166pRH6aaMfyaAy2ph1JUETRTKk4D0fkz?usp=sharing)**
   
   After downloading:
   - Extract the model files to the `trained_model/` directory
   - Ensure all model files (config.json, model.safetensors, tokenizer files, etc.) are placed in the correct location

4. **Initialize the model**
   ```bash
   python main.py --init-model
   ```

5. **Run the backend server**
   ```bash
   python src/backend.py
   ```

6. **Access the application**
   - Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000`
   - Use the text chat interface to interact with the chatbot

## ðŸ’¡ Usage

### Basic Usage
1. **Provide Context**: Enter a paragraph or passage of text that contains the information
2. **Ask Question**: Type your question related to the provided context
3. **Get Answer**: The chatbot will analyze the context and extract the most relevant answer

### Example Interaction
**Context:** 
```
The Eiffel Tower, built by Gustave Eiffel, is a famous landmark in Paris, France. 
It was completed in 1889 and stands 324 meters tall.
```

**Question:** `Who built the Eiffel Tower?`

**Answer:** `Gustave Eiffel`

### Advanced Configuration
